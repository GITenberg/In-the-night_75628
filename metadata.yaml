summary: '"In the Night" by R. Gorell Barnes is a mystery novel written in the early
  20th century. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a quaint English village,
  bringing into focus the tragic murder of Sir Roger Penterton, a figure cloaked in
  unpopularity and abruptness. The plot engages a cast of characters including Inspector
  Humblethorne, who is tasked with unraveling the circumstances surrounding the crime,
  and Philip Castle, the disturbed secretary whose complex relationship with his employer
  becomes pivotal to the investigation.  At the start of the novel, the setting is
  established in the quiet village near Salting Towers, where the unexpected murder
  sets the stage for intrigue and suspicion. The narrative introduces Inspector Humblethorne
  as he begins his holiday only to be drawn into the investigation of Sir Roger''s
  violent death. Another central character, Philip Castle, is revealed to have had
  a contentious relationship with Sir Roger, hinting at underlying tensions that may
  provide motive for the crime. As villagers react to the shocking news, the opening
  builds suspense and lays the groundwork for the detective story to unfold, inviting
  readers to delve into the relationships and mysteries that will be explored throughout
  the unfolding tale. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
